Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception, and today we have AI services that can perform tasks with remarkable accuracy and efficiency. One such AI service is ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text responses to questions and commands. With the ability to process vast amounts of information in real-time, ChatGPT is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology, making it possible to receive quick and accurate answers to a wide range of questions, without the need for human intervention. In this article, we will explore the evolution of AI and the role that intelligent services like ChatGPT are playing in shaping our future.

AWS certifications are highly valued credentials that demonstrate expertise in AWS cloud solutions. The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate is a foundational certification that validates knowledge of core AWS services, security, and architectural principles, and the ability to design and deploy scalable systems on AWS. This certification is suitable for those looking to pursue a career in cloud computing or showcase expertise to their employer or clients. Let’s see if ChatGPT can tackle the AWS certification challenge.

## The Setup

As a consultant, I was intrigued by the capabilities of OpenAI services and ChatGPT in particular. I couldn't help but wonder if this advanced language model could potentially assist or even replace human consultants in certain tasks. To explore this further, I decided to put ChatGPT to the test by challenging it with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam.

I began by using the 10 official [AWS Sample Exam Questions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Sample-Questions.pdf) and fed each question into ChatGPT, one by one, without making any changes. To my surprise, ChatGPT accurately answered 8 out of the 10 questions, leading me to question if this was just a coincidence. Determined to put its abilities to the ultimate test, I decided to give ChatGPT the real certification challenge by presenting it with all 65 questions. The results were astonishing and provided valuable insights into the capabilities of this advanced language model.

## The AWS Certification Challenge

The initial results from ChatGPT's performance on the AWS Sample Exam Questions for the "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate" exam were promising, leaving me eager to discover if ChatGPT could truly pass the certification. The exam is a comprehensive assessment that requires a candidate to correctly answer around 72% of the 65 questions within a 130-minute timeframe. The questions are presented in either multiple choice or multiple response format and are designed to test a candidate's understanding of AWS core services, security, and architectural principles. To learn more about the specifics of the exam, including the format, content, and assessment criteria, interested individuals can consult the official AWS Exam Guide.

It was time to put ChatGPT to the test. To simulate the actual certification exam, I used unofficial exam questions from [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/). Although these questions may not be identical to the actual AWS certification questions, they are widely used by many professionals to prepare for their exams and provide a comprehensive assessment of knowledge. With each question, I fed it to ChatGPT one-by-one, leaving the questions unaltered. The results were automatically collected by the Whizlabs interactive quiz, providing a real-time evaluation of ChatGPT's performance.

After the first questions, it was already clear that ChatGPT was performing remarkably well, even answering complex questions with multiple correct answers correctly, one after another. As the test progressed, I began to feel a growing sense of unease - could it really be that AI was on the brink of surpassing human expertise in the field of AWS certifications? This thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, as I remembered the countless hours of study and preparation I had put into earning my AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification all those years ago. Yet, despite ChatGPT's impressive performance, the moment of relief came when it finally made its first mistakes, providing a slight sense of relief that AI was not yet ready to take over my job.

## The judgment

ChatGPT amazed me with its performance on the AWS certification exam. It tackled 65 questions in real-time with ease, without any glitches or noticeable delays. Its answers were not just quick but also informative - in cases where it didn't get the answer right, it usually chose a plausible option and even provided an explanation for its choice. However, it struggled with questions requiring in-depth knowledge and those with multiple similar answers. Despite these challenges, ChatGPT was able to learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy after being corrected. The big question remained - would ChatGPT's performance be enough to earn the prestigious "AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate" title?

Now, I can finally bring some much-needed relief to my readers! The results of ChatGPT's performance from the AWS certification challenge are in and they are nothing short of remarkable. With an impressive 41 out of 65 answers completely correct, ChatGPT demonstrates a solid 63% accuracy rate, though it falls short of the minimum passing score of 72% required to pass the exam. It's worth noting that the AWS certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam includes 15 unscored questions, which do not impact a candidate's overall score. These unscored questions are used by AWS to gather information for future use as scored questions. Additionally, the exam utilizes a scaled scoring model, with results reported as a scaled score between 100-1,000, and a minimum passing score of 720. Given this information, it's not far-fetched to imagine ChatGPT potentially passing the actual exam, depending on the distribution of unscored questions.

## Summary

The recent evaluation of ChatGPT has left me in awe of its capabilities. ChatGPT exceeded my expectations, showcasing strength and proficiency that truly impressed me. It's exciting to witness the progression of AI and the growth of its capabilities, making it clear that the intelligence of these systems is rapidly advancing. Gone are the days of basic, limited voice assistants - ChatGPT's performance serves as a testament to the sophistication and potential of modern AI.
